“Fundamentals of Computer Simulation” course project;  Fall 2020. 
This was a course project for Discrete Event Simulation Course (21-942) which is an undergraduate course offered in Industrial Engineering Department at
Sharif University of Technology. It had three different phases. 
1st phase: The discription of a workshop is given and we should write a conceptual model for it.
2nd phase: We should write the code and create the operational model for the workshop.
3rd phase: A Policy is given and we should assess that using the model. We also should do sensitivity analysis for at least three different input of the model.

At each phase, we report a CSV table for a desired output.

As an undergraduate student, I got an hands on experience with the topic and specially with queuing theory.
